### Code Journal

- I decided to try to learn and do most of the methods. In order to do that properly, I had to research each one and try to understand their intended purpose. Once I did that, I was able to understand how they worked.

### Potential Uses for each methods

Arrays
- Push Method: can add a new product in the string; the new product will show up at the end of the string
- Unshift Method: if you misplaced the first step in a set of instructions originally, then you can put it back to the front
- Pop Method: if your latest product isn't available anymore, then you can get rid of it
- Shift Method: if the first step isn't necessary anymore in a set of instructions, then you can get rid of it
- Concat Method: if you need to add a certain group of products to your original product list, then you can merge that string
- Slice Method: if you don't want something in your list, then you can take that certain item out
- Splice Method: if you want to add something in your list anywhere, then you can add that item anywhere in that list
- Filter Method: you can 'filter' out certain people's information in a survey form, like age
- Find Method: you can find someone's name in a waitlist 
- Include Method: you can try to find a name or a product within the list, and can either tell you true or false
